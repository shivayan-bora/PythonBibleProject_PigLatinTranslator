# PythonBibleProject_PigLatinTranslator

This is the seventh project from the course The Python Bible containing concepts of loops, data structures, conditionals etc.

# Goal:
The project consists of a translator, where we input some sentence and the program converts into some gibberish coded languages. The rules for the coded language is as follows:
1. If it starts with a vowel, just add "yay" 
2. Otherwise, move the first consonant cluster to end and add "ay"
